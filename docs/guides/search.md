description: How the built-in Cmd+K search works and how it's indexed.

Flect ships with instant search powered by [Pagefind](https://pagefind.app/) — no external search service or API key required.

## How the index is built

Pagefind indexes the site during `npm run build`, not `npm run dev`. The `build` script runs an Astro build first, then points Pagefind at the resulting `dist/` folder to crawl the rendered HTML and generate the search index:

```sh
astro build && pagefind --site dist
```

Because indexing happens against built HTML, there is no live index while you're running the dev server.

## Opening search

The search modal can be opened three ways:

- Clicking the search button in the site header
- Pressing `Cmd+K` (macOS) or `Ctrl+K` (Windows/Linux) anywhere on the site
- Tapping the search icon in the mobile menu

## Controlling what gets indexed

Two data attributes control what Pagefind picks up:

- `data-pagefind-body` marks a region as indexable content. It's already set on the main docs content area, so page bodies are searchable out of the box.
- `data-pagefind-ignore` excludes an element from the index entirely. It's already set on chrome-like regions — the header, footer, sidebar navigation, and mobile panels — so nav links and repeated UI text don't clutter search results.

You generally don't need to touch either attribute unless you're adding new full-page chrome that shouldn't be searchable, or new content areas that should be.

## Trying it locally

<div class="callout warning">
Running `npm run dev` and testing the search box won't return results — there's no index yet. Build first.
</div>

```sh
npm run build && npm run preview
```

This builds the site (including the Pagefind index) and serves it exactly as it would run in production, so you can confirm search is working before you deploy.
